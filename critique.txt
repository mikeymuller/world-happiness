Summary:
This project aims to predict the salary of jobs based on key words in the
description of the job listings. Focusing primarily on tech related jobs, data
was scraped from online postings on Indeed in the 311 largest cities in the US.
The data was cleaned using SQL and OpenRefine, and machine learning algorithms
such as a Random Forest Classifier were used to attempt to predict job salaries
based on key words in the description. Much work needs to be done moving forward,
which includes amassing more relevant data to analyze, and accurate methods for
extracting key phrases from within that data. A focus will be put on tech job
listings and how they compare to listing in other work industries and sectors.

Strengths:
1. You all do a good job describing how you went about and got your idea. I like
that you mention your initial data acquisition process, what was wrong with it,
and how you adjusted your methods to better fit your model.
2. I liked that you described the reasoning behind the decisions you made when
it came to classifying your data and adding columns based on the type of
measurements you wanted to collect and analyze.

Weaknesses:
1. While I like the general information that your visualizations give me about
the data that you collected, they aren't very relevant to the questions that
your project is aiming to answer, or the main goal of your project. I would
love to see some more visualization relating job salaries to the key words in
the description of the jobs.
2. You mention in the end of your report that you plan on focusing primarily on
tech job posts and how they compare to other sectors. I would worry that if a
majority of the listing you pull are from the tech sector, your results will be
skewed to favor key words and terms that are specific to the tech field. You
might want to consider a method to make sure you collect a range of data in
similar proportions across different industries.
